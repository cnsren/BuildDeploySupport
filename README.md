BuildDeploySupport
==================

BuildDeploySupport is a collection of useful build scripts that you can use in your own project. When
you install the package it will create a ./Deploy/Support directory at the same level as your
solution and create a solution folder in your project so you can browse the scripts.

You can then use the scripts to simplify your deployment!

Please note that this is a work in progress.
